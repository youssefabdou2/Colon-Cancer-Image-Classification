# Colon Cancer Image Classification üß¨üî¨

This project develops a **deep learning pipeline** to classify colon histopathology images into **cancerous** (`cancer_good`) and **non-cancerous** (`normal_good`) categories. It leverages **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, model evaluation metrics, and interpretability techniques like **Grad-CAM** to provide explainable predictions for medical research.

## üìä Key Results

- **Accuracy:** 96.8%  
- **Sensitivity (Cancer Recall):** 97.4%  
- **Specificity (Normal Recall):** 95.7%  
- **PPV (Precision ‚Äì Cancer):** 97.4%  
- **NPV (Precision ‚Äì Normal):** 95.7%  

Confusion Matrix (Test Set):  
[[22 1]
[ 1 38]]



ROC Curve and evaluation metrics confirm strong performance with tight **95% confidence intervals**.
